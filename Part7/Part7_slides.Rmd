# Catch up

So far we learned:

* about data types and structures;
* how to ask `R` for help;
* how to write functions;
* about the logic and the flow;
* how to visualise our data;
* and how to efficiently loop in R.

---

# Catch up

```{r, echo=FALSE}
iris %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(sepal = Sepal.Length * Sepal.Width,
         petal = Petal.Length * Petal.Width) %>%

# Revision

## summarise

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  summarise(median_height = median(height),
            median_mass = median(mass))
```

Ooops, what happened? 

This will also not work bc of missing data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
starwars %>%
  summarise(median_height = quantile(height, 0.9),
            median_mass = quantile(mass, 0.9))
```

---

We need to fix it by adding `na.rm = TRUE` or some other filtering/substitution.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  summarise(median_height = quantile(height, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_mass = quantile(mass, 0.9, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Be aware of how you deal with missing datan though. You may be tempted, and sometise it's understandable choice, to use simply use `na.rm = TRUE`. Be warned though, given calculation can be refferred to only subset of your data (i.e. the one that is not missing).

---

But also be causious, as the following:
.pull-left[
```{r}
starwars %>% 
  summarise(median_height = 
              quantile(height, 0.9, 
                       na.rm = TRUE),
            median_mass = 
              quantile(mass, 0.9, 
                       na.rm = TRUE))
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
starwars %>% 
  filter(!is.na(height), 
         !is.na(mass)) %>%
  summarise(median_height = 
              quantile(height, 0.9),
            median_mass = 
              quantile(mass, 0.9))
```
]
```{r}
starwars %>% 
  na.omit() %>%
  summarise(median_height = quantile(height, 0.9),
            median_mass = quantile(mass, 0.9))
```

will give 3 different results. Why?

---

Why will the code give 3 different results?

* `na.rm = TRUE` will result in removal of only the missing value for a cerain calculation;   
* `filter(!is.na(height), !is.na(mass))` will remove all rows with `NA` in the height column or mass;
* `na.omit()` will remove rows with at least one `NA`.

# Excercises

1. Which specie is the heaviest?  
2. Who's the tallest?  
3. Who is the thinnest? (lowest mass to height ratio)  
4. Who is an outlier on the height to mass ratio plot below. 
5. Who has appeared in all movies? Who has appeared in the least movies?  
6. List the most represented species from each homeworld.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="300px", out.width="300px"}

starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  mutate(med_mass = median(mass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  top_n(1, med_mass)

starwars %>% 
  top_n(1, height)
```

---

```{r}
starwars %>%
  mutate(ratio = mass / height) %>%
  top_n(-1, ratio)
```

---

4 - Who is an outlier on the height to mass ratio plot below.

  top_n(1, mass)

---

5 - Who has appeared in all movies?

  unnest(films) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(n_films = n()) %>%

Column `starships` stores information of starships given charater piloted. It stores the names of those starships as a `list`. Firstly, create a new column `n_pilots` which stores number of pilots of each straship. Secondly, list all the characters that piloted the same starship together with that starship name.

```{r}
#your code here
```

Do the same for the `vehicles` column.
