# Before we start

What do we need? 

* R 
To check if you have a working `R` open terminal or search engine in your OS and simply type in `R` and press enter.

If you do not have working R you need to download and install it. You can download it from here: https://www.r-project.org/ or install it with package manager respective to your operating system. 

---

* RStudio

It will look a bit like this (the fresh installation of RStudio will have different outline and colors though ;)).

<img src="./images/RStudio.png" width="50%"/>

Search for RStudio in your list of installed apps on your OS. If you can't find one, follow this link: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download.

---

* Packages

After successfully installing R and RStudion, we need to check if all necessary packages are installed. 

```{r message = TRUE}
if (! "tidyverse" %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"]) {
  print("Installing tidyverse")
  install.packages("tidyverse")
}
library(tidyverse)
```

Ok, now we are ready to proceed!

# Basics

##  Why R?

* **Community**

**R users @ Oxford** 
* website: https://r-oxford.github.io/
* MeetUp page: https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/
---
* Data analysis and visualisation (especially tidyverse and ggplot2 ♥️)

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggsci)
mtcars %>%
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl),
         am = as.factor(am)) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = cyl, y = mpg, color = am, fill = am)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge()) + 
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5, position = "dodge") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests (mtcars)",
       x = "Number of cylinders",
       y = "Miles/(US) gallon",
       fill = "Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)",
       color = "Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_color_simpsons() +
  scale_fill_simpsons()
```

* Statistics done **right**!

From Agresti (1990, p. 61f; 2002, p. 91) Fisher's Tea Drinker
A British woman claimed to be able to distinguish whether milk or tea was added to the cup first.  To test, she was given 8 cups of tea, in four of which milk was added first.  The null hypothesis is that there is no association between the true order of pouring and the woman's guess, the alternative that there is a positive association (that the odds ratio is greater than 1).

```{r}
TeaTasting <- matrix(c(3, 1, 1, 3),
                     nrow = 2,
                     dimnames = list(Guess = c("Milk", "Tea"),
                                     Truth = c("Milk", "Tea")))
fisher.test(TeaTasting, alternative = "greater")
```

## Looking for help

### Ask R first.

If you know the name of the function you're having questions about.

```{r}
?mean
```

Or if you're not sure the exact name of the function, you can search through the help docs.

```{r}
??mean
```

---

## Using R as calclator

```{r}
2 + 7
```

smoething more complicated

```{r}
1234 * 5678 ^ 9
```

---

or really, really complex ;) 

<img src="https://amp.insider.com/images/5a4bdcc6cb9df434008b4577-750-362.png" width="50%"/>

```{r}
# type in the equation here and execute chunk to learn the answer
```

<img src="https://amp.insider.com/images/5a4bdcc6cb9df434008b4577-750-362.png" width="50%"/>

```{r}
# type in the equation here and execute chunk to learn the answer
6 / 2 * (1 + 2) 
```

and last one

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/mindyourdecisions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/viral-meme-230-preview-600.png" width="40%"/>

```{r}
230 - 220 / 2 == 5
```

hmm, that's not exactly 5bind symbols to function r...

and last one

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/mindyourdecisions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/viral-meme-230-preview-600.png" width="40%"/>

```{r}
# the devil is in the detail ;)
230 - 220 / 2 == factorial(5)
```

---

## Variables and variable assignment

Let's save the value of 1 to a variable `my_first_number` and 2 to a variable `my_second_number`. We will use two different ways of variable assignment.

```{r}
my_first_number <- 1
my_second_number = 2
```

Let's check if we were successful.

```{r}
my_first_number + my_second_number
```

---

We can print the values in our variables by typing their names and running the line. 

```{r}
my_first_number
```

But know that this will only work in interactive mode. If you want to print the value - use the `print` function.

```{r}
print(my_second_number)
```

---

## Data structures

In R we have access to the following data structures:

| dimensionality | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 1d | Atomic vector | List |
| 2d | Matrix | Data frame |
| nd | Array | |

### Vectors.

The function used most often (I think) in R: `c()` - short for combine. It basically takes the arguments and *combines*.

```{r}
dbl_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4) # double = numeric
int_vector <- c(2L, 4L, 6L, 8L) # integer (integers require less storage space)
chr_vector <- c("this", "is", "a", "character", "vector")
log_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, T, F) # logical
```

`c()` will reduce the complexity of the combination, so the following:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3, 4) == c(1, c(2, c(3, c(4))))
```
is true.
---

We can check the type of the data ussing `typeof()` function.

```{r}
typeof(dbl_vector)
```

```{r}
typeof(int_vector)
```
Both are, so called, numeric. 
```{r}
is.numeric(int_vector)
is.numeric(dbl_vector)
```
---


```{r}
this_and_that <- c("this", "that", "this", "this", "that")
fct_vector <- as.factor(this_and_that)
```
What's the difference between them?

```{r}
this_and_that
```

```{r}
fct_vector
```


---
**Important note.** `T` and `F` are understood as `TRUE` and `FALSE`
```{r}
log_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, T, F) # logical
print(log_vector)
```
however, it is really **bad practice** to use the `F` as it can be overwritten. Let's imagine you are writting some analysis and you need an F statistics. You save it to a variable `F`.
```{r}
# 95th percentile of F distribution with (5, 2) degrees of freedom
F <- qf(.95, df1 = 5, df2 = 2) 
```
Then, many lines later you are trying to save some logical vector.
```{r}
log_vector2 <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, T, F)
print(log_vector2)
```
Logical vector no more. And when you compare it with the original one:
```{r}
log_vector2 == log_vector 
```
Ooops...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rm(F)
```

---

What happens if we put different types of variables in one vector?

```{r}
# create a vector (comb_vect) that will be a combination of logical and character vector
comb_vect <- c()
```

Let's see how it looks like

```{r}
 print(comb_vect)
```

what's its type?

```{r}
typeof(comb_vect)
```

```

```{r}
typeof(comb_vect)
```

Out of curiosity, try another combination.

### Lists

List is just a collection of many things and types. We can store a lot of thins in lists. 

```{r}
my_list <- list(first_element = log_vector,
                second = chr_vector,
                int_vector)
my_list
```

---

### Matrices

Matrices are just tables with rows and columns. 

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(1:10, nrow = 2, ncol = 5)
my_matrix
```

We can name the columns and rows.

```{r}
colnames(my_matrix) <- paste0("column_", 1:5)
rownames(my_matrix) <- paste0("row_", 1:2)

my_matrix
```

---

### Data frames

```{r}
my_df <- data.frame(column_1 = int_vector,
                    column_2 = c("yes", "no", "yes", "yes"),
                    row.names = paste0("row_", 1:4),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
my_df
```

```{r}
my_df2 <- as.data.frame(my_matrix)
my_df2
```

---

## Operations

### Vectors

First, let's remind ourselves whit some vectors we already have.

```{r}
chr_vector
dbl_vector
```
#### Subsetting 
Let's get the 3rd element of the chr vector.
```{r}
chr_vector[3]
```

Now, we can print more elements than one at once.

```{r}
dbl_vector[1:3]
```

Or just specific positions

```{r}
chr_vector[c(1,4)]
```

---

Excercise!

Given a vector `nums` with numbers from 1 to 20, access the numbers divisible by 5.

```{r}
nums <- 1:20
nums[]
```

---

Excercise!

Given a vector `nums` with numbers from 1 to 20, access the numbers divisible by 5.

```{r}
nums <- 1:20
nums[c(5, 10, 15, 20)]
```

---
We can also create named vectors.

```{r}
my_first_named_vector <- 1:10
names(my_first_named_vector) <- paste0("position_", 1:10)
```

and then access them by names.

```{r}
my_first_named_vector['position_1']
```

```{r}
my_first_named_vector[1]
```

---

### Lists

Remember the list we created earlier?

```{r}
my_list
```

To access the elements, we can call them by names

```{r}
my_list$second
```

or by partial match :o

```{r}
my_list$f
```

or by positions.

```{r}
my_list[[3]]
```
